It is a  great privilege to present the Annual Report of India Meteorological Department (IMD) for 
the year 2022. The report highlights significant activities of the department during the year. The 
department has been playing a leading role in the field of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences by 
providing eminent services in meteorology and  allied fields. The safety are critical for protecting 
life and property, safeguarding the environment and for efficient management of natural resources 
for sustainable development.  
 
During 2022, the Departmentâ€™s progressive strode towards modernization of scientific infrastructure 
in the fields of meteorological observations , information systems and numerical modelling . It  
helped to render better services in areas of disaster management, agriculture, aviation, shipping, 
fisheries, energy and transport. IMDâ€™s services of very short range (up to 6 hrs), short  range (up to”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$31151953-ae90-430c-abee-300adb3bb364”h

advance) and  long range (monthly and seasonal)  forecast alongwith severe weather (cyclones, 
thunderstorms, heavy rainfall, heat wave, cold wave, fog , etc.) warnings continuously improved to 
meet the demands of the user agencies, disaster managers, emergency response groups , other 
stakeholders and general public. 
 
As a part of R&D, IMD encourages through publication of quarterly journal MAUSAM. The 
international research journal MAUSAM ( formerly Indian Journal of Met eorology, Hydrology & 
Geophysics) has entered into 73 rd year of its publications and  has been made online 
(https://mausamjournal.imd.gov.in/index.php/MAUSAM) since 2021. Since then the journal has 
been making its way to advancement in the world of scientific journals reaching the Impact Factor 
of 1.01 in 2021. All the research articles (since the origin of â€˜MAUSAMâ€™, 1950) have been”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$2b830cf7-f930-4878-a054-7334d0814e0f”h

uploaded on the website and the Digital Object Identifiers (DOIâ€™s) for all of them have been 
assigned. The scientists in IMD ha ve published 115 research papers in peer reviewed national and 
International journals during the year 2022. 
 
IMD monitors the climate parameters and provides annual climate treatment to the country, WMO 
and IPCC.  
 
The average global temperature in 2022 wa s about 1.15 (1.02 to 1.27) oC above the pre -industrial 
levels. The 2022 is the 8 th consecutive year (2015- 2022) that annual global temperatures have 
reached at least 1  Â°C above pre-industrial levels, according to all datasets compiled by WMO.  The 
annual mean land surface air temperature averaged over India during 2022 was+0.51 oC above the 
long-term average (1981 -2010 period). The year 2022 was the fifth warmest year on record since 
nationwide records commenced in 1901.”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$c8671e42-aad1-42cb-bc11-c0726f80f2af”h

The temperatures were consistently 3 Â°C-8 Â°C above normal breaking many decadal and some all -
time records in several parts of the country, including the western Himalayas, the plains of Punjab, 
Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The states of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, 
Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Jharkhand also experienced heatwaves, in some areas severe, with 
temperatures ranging from 40  Â°Câ€“44 Â°C in the last days of March, 2022. The heatwave conditions 
continued into April, reaching its preliminary peak towards the end of t he month. Heatwaves also 
increase the risk of forest-fires.  Around 300 large forest fires occurred in the country on April 28, a 
third of these in Uttarakhand. By April 29, almost 70 percent of India was affected by the heatwave.”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$377d44af-05ab-4829-95d0-677920aa8610”h

of India. Anomalously high temperatures during these months adversely affected grain filling and 
cause early senescence, thus reducing yields. 
 
During 2022, 15 cyclonic disturbances (three cyclonic storms and 12 depressions) formed over the 
north Indian Ocean against the normal of 11.2 based on data of 1965 -2021. It included three 
cyclones, seven depressions formed over Bay of Bengal and three depressions over Arabian Sea and 
two land depressions. Overall, the frequency of formation of depressions over the region was above 
normal and that of cyclones was below normal during 2022. In addition to these, extreme weather 
events like extremely heavy rainfall, floods, landslide, lightning, thunderstorm, droughts etc were 
also experienced in various parts of the country. The early warning provided by IMD enabled”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$87f4c9b3-2fd3-45cf-90ce-2c7e6082d064”h

disaster managers to minimize long lives due to cyclone to 46 in asian region in 2022. 
 
IMD, Ministry of Earth Sciences in active collaboration with ICAR, State Agricultural University 
and Other Institutes is rendering the weather forecast based Agromet Advisory Services (AAS) to 
the farmers at district/block level through a network of existing 130 Agro-Met Field Units 
(AMFUs) and 199 District AgroMet Units (DAMUs). These agromet advisories are being prepared 
and disseminated by 329 units (AMFUs/DAMU) twice a week (Tuesday and Friday) covering 700 
districts and 3100 blocks of the country under Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS). AAS 
bulletins are also prepared and issued at state levels on every Tuesday & Friday and at National 
level on every Friday to cater to the needs of users at various levels. The bulletins include past”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$8b5b0d04-b247-4996-9d7a-f8bc2c263292”h

CHAPTER 1  
  
INDIA METEOROLOGICAL  DEPARTMENT - OVERVIEW  
 
 
 
 
India Meteorological Department, Ministry of Earth Sciences is the National Meteorological Service of the 
country and the principal Government agency in all matters re lating to Meteorology, Seismology and 
allied discipline and provides weather and climate services to the public and specialized sectors. 
 
Itâ€™s mandate is: 
 
 
â€¢ To take meteorological observations and to provide current and forecast meteorological information 
for optimum operation of weather- sensitive activities like agriculture, irrigation, shipping, aviation, 
offshore oil explorations, etc.  
 
â€¢ To warn against severe weather phenomena like tropical cyclones, norwesters, duststorms, heavy 
rains and snow, cold and heat waves, etc., which cause destruction of life and property.  
 
â€¢ To provide meteorological statistics required for agriculture, water resource management, industries,”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$c97f790c-9329-455a-b2ef-b3d75e039636”h
)”}”(h
}”(hhšh}”(hhhKuhXÀ  oil exploration and other nation-building activities.  
 
â€¢ To conduct and promote research in meteorology and allied disciplines.  
 
â€¢ To detect and locate earthquakes and to evaluate seismicity in different parts of the country for 
development projects.  
 
A disastrous tropical cyclone struck Calcutta in 1864 and this was followed by failures of the monsoon rains 
in 1866 and 1871. In the year 1875, the G overnment of India established the India Meteorological 
Department, bringing all meteorological work in the country under a central authority. Mr. H. F. Blanford 
was appointed Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India.  
 
From a modest beginning in 1875, IMD has progressively expanded its infrastructure for meteorological 
observations, communications, forecasting and weather services and it has achieved a parallel scientific 
growth. IMD has always used contemporary technology. In the telegraph age, it made extensive use of”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$fe08a74b-da8d-4125-bb68-84d05e14fe9f”h
)”}”(h
}”(hh¡h}”(hhhKuhXU  weather telegrams for collecting observational data and sending warnings. Later IMD became the first 
organization in India to have a message switching computer for supporting its global data exchange. One of 
the first few electronic computers introduced in the country was provided to IMD for scientific applications 
in meteorology. India was the first developing country in the world to have its own geostationary satellite, 
INSAT, for continuous weather monitoring of this part of the globe and particularly for cyclone warning. 
IMD has continuously ventured into new areas of application and service, and steadily built upon its infra -
structure in its history of 145 years. It has simultaneously nurtured the growth of meteorology and 
atmospheric science in India. Today, meteorology in India is poised at the threshold of an exciting future.”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$4d1d19bd-79f3-477f-952c-bdd63dfce568”h

India had some of the oldest meteorological observatories of the world and the first astronomical and 
meteorological unit started at Madras in 1793. Thus, meteorological observation in India was taken even 
prior to the establishment of the department in 1875.  Since then IMD has achieved many milestones 
during the period from 1793 to 2022.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Director General of Meteorology is the Head of the India Meteorological Department, with 
headquarters at New Delhi. For the convenience of administrative and technical control, there are 6 
Regional Meteorological Centres, each under a Deputy Director General with headquarters at Mumbai, 
Chennai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Nagpur and Guwahati. Under the administrative control of Deputy Director 
General, there are different types of operational units such as Meteorological Centres, Forecasting Offices,  
Agromet. Advisory Centres, Flood Meteorological Offices and Cyclone Detection Radar Stations.”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$28ab6d4f-43cd-4b33-a3e4-dfe10c1379d8”h

southern peninsular India (198.2 mm) was the fifth 
highest since 1901. The mean temperature for the 
pre-monsoon seaso n this year was 28.68 Â°C with 
an anomaly of 1.06 Â°C and the second highest after 
the year 2010 (28.89 Â° C) since 1901. Mean 
temperature over Northwest India (26.98 Â° C) was 
highest, Central India (30.47 Â° C) was second 
highest after the year 2010 (30.59 Â° C) and East & 
Northeast India (26.71 Â° C) was seventh highest 
since 1901.

Standardized Precipitation Index 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an 
index used for monitoring drought and is based on 
only precipitation.  This index is negative for dry, 
and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or wet 
conditions become more severe, the index 
becomes more negative or positive. Figs. 11(a&b) 
give the SPI values for the Pre-monsoon season 
this year and for the period from the past 
monsoon season , i.e., June 2021 -May 2022 (12 
months cumulative) respectively.

NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION 
 
 
Global and Regional Modelling (NWP) 
 
GFS Model 
 
Global Fo recasting System (GFS T1534L64) model 
is run operationally at India Meteorological 
Department (IMD) four times in a day (0000, 0600, 
1200 & 1800 UTC) to give deterministic forecast in 
the short to medium range upto 10 days. The 
forecast model has a resolution of approximately 
12 km in horizontal and has 64 levels in the 
vertical. The initial conditions for this GFS model is 
generated from the four -dimensional (4D) 
ensemble-variational data assimilation (DA) system 
(4DEnsVar) building upon the grid point sta tistical 
interpolation (GSI) -based hybrid Global Data 
Assimilation System (GDAS) run on High 
Performance Computing Systems (HPCS) at 
National Center for Medium Range Weather 
Forecasting (NCMRWF). The real-time GFS 
T1534L64 model outputs are generated daily  at 
IMD. This 4DEnsVar data assimilation system has”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$b19700ea-b128-4646-9c3b-108096b8dd6e”h

IMD. This 4DEnsVar data assimilation system has 
capabilities to assimilate various conventional as 
well as satellite observations including radiances 
from different polar orbiting and geostationary 
satellites. The real-time outputs are made available 
to operational weather forecasters and various 
users through the national web site of IMD. Fig. 1 
shows the forecast and observed heavy rainfall 
event of 22nd August, 2022 during south west 
monsoon 2022. 
 
GEFS Model 
 
Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) GEFS is an 
operational weather model at IMD to address 
underlying uncertainties in the input data such 
limited coverage, instruments or observing 
systems biases, and the limitations of the model 
itself.    GEFS   quantifies   these   uncertainties    by

generating multiple forecasts, which in turn 
produce a range of pote ntial outcomes based on 
differences or perturbations applied to the data 
after it has been incorporated into the model. 
Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) at IMD is 
adopted from NCEP and it runs in ~12 km (T1534) 
resolution. The total number of 21 Ensembles (20 
perturbed forecasts + 1 control forecast) 
constitutes the ensemble system. These 20-
ensemble members are generated by Ensemble 
Kalman Filter (EnKF) method from the forecast 
perturbation of the previous cycles four times a 
day (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC) at all 64 model vertical 
levels. These analysis perturbations are added to 
the reconfigured analysis obtained from the hybrid 
four-dimensional Ensemble variational data 
assimilation system (GDASHybrid4DEnsVar) as part 
of the suite. The 243 hours forecast of GEFS is 
routinely generated based on 0000UTC and 1200 
UTC initial conditions which include a control”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$ef25faf7-cacf-452d-b0d9-545bc07d8025”h

perturbed initial condition (Deshpande et al ., 
2020). 
 
WRF model 
 
During southwest monsoon season 2022, the WRF 
model (ARW) delivered three days forecasts at 3 
km horizontal resolution four times daily at 0000, 
0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC with hourly interval. The 
data assimilation component, regional GSI (Global 
Statistical Interpolation) takes global GFS analysis 
and all other conventional quality -controlled 
observations as its input and generates mesoscale 
analysis at 3 km resolution. The model produced 
forecasts over a domain spanning about 5 Â° S to   
41Â° N in n orth-south and 49 Â° E to 102 Â° E in east -
west directions respectively. Fig. 2 portrays skill

HWRF-Ocean (HYCOM/POM-TC) coupled model 
 
During pre -monsoon and post -monsoon cyclone 
seasons of 2022, the movable triple nested HWRF -
Ocean (HWRF/POM -TC) coupled model with 
horizontal resolutions of 18 km, 6 km and 2 km 
delivered five days forecasts four times a day at 
0000 UTC, 0600 UTC, 1200 UTC and 1800 UTC for 
tropical cyclones formed over north Indian Ocean 
(NIO). The data assimilation component of HWRF, 
regional GSI Data Assimilation, generated 
mesoscale analysis for intermediate and innermost

for all three domains. The model parent domain 
(18 km horizontal resolution) remained stationary

existing HPCS Aditya, the operational ERF system 
was migrated to Pratyush HPCS system in June 
2022. To see how this break and active phase is 
predicted in the ERF the weak phase of monsoon 
during the period from 29 July to 04 August and 
the active phase during the period from 05 -25 
August, 2022 is shown in Fig. 5. The weak phase of 
monsoon during the period 29 July to 04 August is 
very clearly seen in Fig. 6 based on the initial 
condition of 20th July, 2022.   The forecast weekly 
rainfall anomalies are also shown in Fig. 7 based on 
the initial conditions of 27 July and 03 August.  
Thus, the model could capture these active phases 
of monsoon for the period from 05 - 25 August. On 
smaller spatial scales (homogeneous regions and 
met subdivision levels) the forecast shows useful 
skill up to two weeks. On met subdivision level the”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$b1232807-5da0-414e-a1ac-dfe563c4ff56”h

Development of MME based operational forecast 
product for 153 River sub-basin 
 
The summer monsoon rainfall is the major water 
source for most parts of India and people depend 
on this water source for their livelihood. The 
rainfall during this season is highly variable over 
space and time. The rainfall during the sou thwest 
monsoon period is the main source of flow 
discharge in most of the rivers in India.  
 
The MME forecast product for the 153 river sub -
basin is developed and operationalized for the five 
days forecast. Each day forecast is based on the 
simple MME of five global models as shown in the 
Table above. The area average values over each

CHAPTER 4 
 
OBSERVATIONAL NETWORK 
 
One of the mandates of IMD is to take 
meteorological observations for use by different 
users.  Strengthening of atmospheric observational 
network and its regular maintenance is absolutely 
required to sustain and improve skill of weather 
forecasts. IMD has been augmenting its observing 
system networks over the past years.  
 
4.1. Upper Air Observational Network 
 
Radiosounding Radiowind (RS/RW) network 
 
India Meteorological Departm ent (IMD) has 43 
operational Radiosonde radiowind stations in their 
upper air network, as a part of global observing 
system (GOS) network of WMO,. These stations 
take observations for measuring the vertical profile 
of the Atmosphere, viz ., Temperature , Pre ssure, 
humidity, Wind Speed and Direction, the upper air 
observations are taken by using balloon borne 
soundings. These stations are engaged in taking 
the radiosounding observations twice a day at”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$23793f26-39b9-4bff-957c-b76b142d41ff”h

As a subset of Global Observing System (GOS) 
network, World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) in collaboration with the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the 
International Council for Science (ICSU) established 
Global Climate Observing system (GCOS) network 
in 1992, as an outcome of 2nd World Climate 
Conference. In the u pper air domain of GCOS, 
aiming on further improvement of upper air data 
quality, IMD established GUAN standard 
radiosounding observations at its 6 Regional 
Meteorological Centres (New Delhi, Mumbai, 
Kolkata, Chennai, Guwahati and Nagpur). The 
performance of these stations was presented at”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$9b723c38-0f12-4d56-a37a-b2bb16319823”h

WMO Technical Conference on Instruments and 
Methods of Observations (TECO -2016) and a 
formal claim was made to Secretary General WMO 
for inclusion of these stations into the GCOS Upper 
Air Network (GUAN) (Fig.1).  
 
Based on the sustained performance, these 
stations have been included in the WMO - GUAN 
standard network by GCOS Secretariat, and their

Urban Meteorological Services 
 
An   exponential   growth   of   urban   populations   
has   become   a   driving   force   for   human 
development, particularly in developing countries. 
Although, crowded cities are centres of creativity 
and economic progress, but face serious challenges 
on account of polluted air, extreme weather 
conditions, flooding and other hazards. 
Increasingly dense, complex and interde pendent 
urban fabrics are rendering cities vulnerable: a 
single extreme event can lead to a widespread 
breakdown of a city's infrastructure often through”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$e169e7e3-6a91-463a-81b1-169883a32741”h

breakdown of a city's infrastructure often through 
cascading downstream or â€œdominoâ€ effects. 
Urbanization and the developing cities is the face 
of the ec onomic growth of India. Urban areas are 
seats of socioeconomic activities. How climate 
change will affect cities is currently poorly 
understood â€“ but is of enormous economic and 
societal relevance because of the many 
infrastructural investments and population in the 
region. Cities, additionally, create their own 
microclimate due to urban heat islands, and 
modifying regional hydrology (through rainfall 
changes), and air quality (urban aerosols). 
 
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 
recognizes that rapid urbanization necessitates on 
new types of services which make the best use of 
science and technology and considers the 
challenge of delivering these as one of the main 
priorities for the meteorological community. Urban”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$4faffc6f-1a5d-4f29-986f-c9598bb32351”h

Services, in the traditional sens e are related to 
transportation, housing, water management, 
waste management, snow clearance, etc.   In 
rapidly changing urban complexion,   there is need 
of Urban Integrated Services containing weather, 
climate, hydrology and air quality infrastructure 
(data, observations, predictions) to support 
traditional (and new) urban services Over the 
years, specialized services have also been built for 
state-of-the-art Monitoring, Detection and Early 
Warning of extreme weather phenomena covering 
tropical cyclones,   thunderstorms,   cyclones,   
coastal inundation, flooding, air quality, health -
related stress, dust storms, heavy rains and 
snowfall events, cold and heat waves, etc. as well 
as to climate services for building codes, zoning, 
planning and design.

R&D efforts in Urban Meteorological Services 
 
The growth in cities and the concentration of 
resources being used in the urban region impa ct 
the environmental carrying capacity. This leads to 
unintended consequences such as increasing air 
pollution, increasing urban heat stress, health 
impacts, stressed mobility, and energy use. There 
are also long -term changes that affect the 
resiliency due  to changes in the rainfall patterns 
and extremes. For example, in a recent study 
developed over Indian monsoon region, it was 
shown that the increase in the rainfall extremes 
that was observed in recent decades is only noted 
over those regions which have seen increased 
urbanization. A number of studies have shown this 
result through different analyses and datasets. 
There is an ongoing challenge to assess the range 
of such changes (e.g. heat waves, floods, water 
shortages, etc.), and develop a good understanding”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$2c4ad9fe-9a93-473e-8743-c409a30a1fdb”h

of the cause -effect (attribution/detection) studies.

urban specific morphological changes in simulating 
severe convection of Bhubaneswar city. Further 
studies have also confirmed the realistic 
representation of dynamic land use land cover 
changes in the very high resolution cloud

about 60 km south-southeast of Machilipatnam in 
the early hours (0230 hrs IST) of 11th May.  
 
â€¢ Thereafter, it started moving nearly 
northwards with a very slow speed and weakened 
into a deep depression over westcentral Bay of 
Bengal close to Andhra Pradesh coast in the 
evening (1730 hrs IST) of 11th May.

Salient Features 
 
(i) Weakening before touching coast 
 
The severe cyclonic storm, â€œASANIâ€œ weakened into 
a deep depression before touching the coast 
mainly due to following reasons: 
 
â€¢ It entered a region with lower sea surface 
temperature and lower ocean heat content  
â€¢ It moved very slow (5 -6 kmph against normal 
speed of 13 kmph) near the coast and remained 
within 50 km from the coastline from morning to 
evening of 11th May. The slow movement led to 
upwelling of sea water and rainfall over the Sea 
leading to further cooling of sea surface. 
â€¢ Due to slow movement, there was also land 
interaction for longer time leading to weakening 
due to increased friction with land surface. 
â€¢ There was cold and dry air incursion from 
Indian landmass in the middle and upper 
troposphere which are unfavourable for”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$d0a1db05-973c-4c37-84a9-b291e25e38ae”h
)”}”(h
}”(hj2  h}”(hhhK@uhXÜ  Indian landmass in the middle and upper 
troposphere which are unfavourable for 
maintaining the intensity of any cyclonic storm.   
 
(ii) Multiple recurvatures 
 
Severe cyclonic storm â€œAsaniâ€ exhibit ed multiple 
recurvatures in its track/path. Most of the models 
suggested change in direction of movement of the 
system from northwest to northeast near the 
coast. However, the deep depression (remnant of 
cyclone Asani) moved slowly northward/  
northwestwards on 11 th May till evening and 
slowly west -southwestwards thereafter. It was 
mainly due to the fact the cyclonic storm was 
supposed to move northeastwards near the coast 
under the influence of a short amplitude westerly 
trough in middle and upper tropospheric levels 
approaching from the west. However, as the storm 
weakened while approaching towards coast, the 
height of the storm decreased being limited to 
middle tropospheric levels. As a result the steering 
wind of the storm changed being dominated by”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$e9b3cca1-4823-4831-88e3-09b4cea990c5”h
)”}”(h
}”(hj9  h}”(hhhK@uhXÕ  middle tropospheric levels. As a result the steering 
wind of the storm changed being dominated by 
southeasterly winds and led to northwestward 
movement. However, the northwestward 
movement was restricted/ blocked due to an 
anticyclone lying over the peninsular India. Thus, 
the system moved slowly & remained practically 
stationary near to the coast followed with slow 
west-southwestward movement till its weakening 
into a well marked low pressure area in the 
morning of 12th May over the region. 
 
Monitoring of Severe Cyclonic Storm, ASANI  
 
India Meteorological Department (IMD) 
maintained round the clock watch over the north 
Indian Ocean and the cyclone was monitored since 
28th April, about 8 days prior to the formation of

Operational landfall point and time forecast errors and skill compared to  
long period average during 2017-21 
 
 
The track forecast errors for 24, 48 and 60 hrs lead 
period were 82, 126 and 205 km respectively 
against the long period average (LPA) errors (2017-
21) of 73, 106, and 122 km respectively. The 
relatively higher error in the track forecast for 48 
and 60 hrs was mainly due to the fast movement 
of the cyclone during evening and night of 24 th 
October under the influence of westerly trough to 
the west of cyclone centre and also the fact that 
Sitrang had followed a recurving track. 
 
 
â€¢ The landfall point forecast errors for 24, 48 
and 60 hrs lead period were 17.4, 33.5, 35.0 km 
respectively against the LPA errors (2017 -21) of 
31.9, 61.5 and 61.1  km during 2017 -21 
respectively. The pre- genesis forecast issued at 
0300 UTC of 21st October (about 3.5 days prior to

with an error of about 82.5 km against the LPA 
error of about 120 km for 84 hours lead period. 
Though, it was a recurving track, the landfall point 
errors were appreciably less than the LPA errors 
for all lead period.  
 
â€¢ The landfall time forecast errors for 24, 48 
and 60 hrs lead period were 3.0, 5.0 and 5.5 hours 
respectively against the LPA errors (2017-21) o f 
2.5, 5.0 and 5.3 hours during 2017 -21 respectively. 
For all lead periods, the landfall time errors were 
comparable to the LPA errors. 
 
â€¢ The absolute error (AE) of intensity (wind) 
forecast for 24, 48 and 60 hrs lead period were 6.2, 
8.2 and 12.7 knots against the LPA errors of 7.8, 
11.5 and 12.7 knots during 2017- 21 respectively. 
The error in intensity forecast were appreciably

Short-range Warning of Intense Rainstorms in 
Localised Systems (SWIRLS) 
 
SWIRLS is based on the extrapolation of radar 
echoes using the TREC (Tracking Radar Echoes by 
Correlation) technique. With a suitable choice of 
pixel array size on the radar reflectivity maps, the 
TREC vectors derived can be used to monitor and 
extrapolate echo motion right across the”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$81227ba0-c452-43d4-8323-921c425e369e”h

}”(hj_  h}”(hhhKMuhXt  TREC vectors derived can be used to monitor and 
extrapolate echo motion right across the 
mesoscale spectrum, from individual convective 
cells, to supercells  and clusters, and to groups of 
rain bands or squall lines. 
 
 
On the basis of TREC, quantitative precipitation  
forecast  (QPF)  algorithms  have   been developed 
to produce high resolution forecast rainfall 
distribution maps over the local area. These maps 
provide useful objective guidance for forecasters 
to assess the likely rain scenario in the next 30, 60 
& 120 minutes along with analysis and to facili tate 
decision-making in operating the Rainstorm”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$b0cc6bb2-74f5-4de1-b413-b52fe93646b3”h

New Initiatives undertaken by Nowcast Unit 
 
(i) Automation of district nowcast verification   
IMD operationally issues district level nowcasts for 
severe weather for all districts of India round the 
clock at three hourly intervals since 2018. The 
phenomena for which nowcasts are issued include: 
(a) Thunderstorms and associated weather and (b) 
rainfall. All these nowcasts are updated every 
three hours on the IMD website (https 
://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest/contents/distric
twisewarnings.php). The data from the ground 
based lightning array network of the Indian 
Institute of Tropical Meteorology and Indian Air 
Force has been used for verification of the District”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$254f7e32-6057-4bef-956c-7720b3f03ab8”h

}”(hjm  h}”(hhhKNuhX½  Force has been used for verification of the District 
level Nowcasts. This networ k currently has 83 
sensors and provides spatial accuracy of about 500 
m. The point data for lightning with lat -long 
coordinates is provided from the network in near 
realtime mode to IMD at 15 minute intervals for 
operational use. The point data is geolocated up to 
the district level using open source â€œNominatim 
Serverâ€ software. For verification purposes, a yes-
no criterion (2x2 configuration table) is applied for 
occurrence-non-occurrence of thunderstorms in 
each district. All the eleven categories of nowc asts 
for thunderstorms and associated weather are 
considered for verification. A minimum of 2 (two) 
incidences of lightning occurrence in a district 
within the validity period of a nowcast is 
considered occurrence of thunderstorm over that 
district. The two flashes may occur concurrently or 
subsequently in time in any part of the district”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$5ec8cf71-cf80-4a9e-aa11-850955b9e40f”h

within a period of three hours, i.e. , during the 
validity time of the nowcast for the district. Based 
on both observation and nowcast for 
thunderstorms (any one of the eleven categories), 
the forecast skill scores have been calculated.

(ii) Crowdsourcing  
 
The term â€œcrowdsourcingâ€ was first coined in 2006 
by American journalist Jeff Howe who defined it as 
â€œthe act of a company or institution taking a 
function once performed by employees and 
outsourcing it to an undefined (and general large) 
network of people in the form of an open call. 
 
In recent years, with the improved understanding 
of the mesoscale nature of weather systems over 
Indian region, the constraints of the existing 
observatory network are sought to be 
supplemented by other sources of observations. 
This requirement has been partly met by remote 
sensed observations of weather by radar and 
satellite based instruments and  the lightning 
detection network. However, in the absence of”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$819154c8-12da-4ca3-98fa-61175262a2ba”h
)”}”(h
}”(hj‚  h}”(hhhKOuhXã  satellite based instruments and  the lightning 
detection network. However, in the absence of 
validation with ground data, the limitations of each 
instrument hamper the process of forming a clear 
picture of the weather occurred and its intensity 
and impact. The lack of clarity in observat ions 
causes uncertainty in forecasts of subsequent 
weather and its associated impact. With the 
widespread availability of smart phones, 
information regarding the state of the atmosphere 
can now be obtained from many non-traditional 
sources in text, audio and video form from sources 
such as citizen scientists (Wiggins and Crowston, 
2011), amateur weather stations and sensors, 
smart devices and social- media/web 2.0 (Muller           
et al.).  
 
Since 2021, IMD has started an online interface 
(Fig (yy) to collect the information of the weather 
that has occurred as well as the associated impact 
information for six weather events initially , viz., 
Rain. Hail, Duststorm, Wind Speed,”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$a0f122fc-ac13-460b-932a-a7c0d02bfd4e”h

1. Flash Flood Guidance Servic es : Recent 
initiatives under the flagship Flash Flood Guidance 
Services for South Asia programme: 
 
(I) Integration of Landslide Susceptibility Module 
into Flash Flood Guidance System for better 
predictability of landslide associated flash floods in 
the vulnerable hilly regions of Indian Subcontinent. 
Landslides are a major hydro -geological hazard 
that is invariably triggered due to incessant rains in 
conjunction with human intervention impacting 
the topographical features of the area. During the 
past few flood seasons, these events are 
increasingly witnessed in the Rudraprayag district 
of Uttarakhand and Wayanad district of Kerala. In 
collaboration with GSI, NRSC, IMD and HRC, a 
virtual training was conducted on 29th June, 2022”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$19778141-a12e-4626-a459-cfaa28d16096”h

At the time of Independence, India had a large 
number of different calendars with divergent 
methods of reckoning the time. These calendars”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$4aff8542-5e9b-449b-9827-6ad9dbb9a0a9”h

methods of reckoning the time. These calendars 
reflected the rich and varied political, cultural and 
historical traditions of India. Each calendar system 
had its advantages and  disadvantages. Therefore, 
there was a need to adopt a scientific approach 
and evolve a uniform calendar for the entire 
country. 
 
It was felt desirable by the Government of India to 
have uniformity in the calendar throughout the 
country for civic, social a nd other purposes. The 
Government appointed a Calendar Reform 
Committee in November, 1952, under CSIR with 
Prof. MeghnadSaha as Chairman with a view to 
develop a unified National Calendar on the basis of 
most accurate modern astronomical data for the 
interest of national integrity. The committee 
recommended preparation of the Indian 
Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac calculated with 
most modern astronomical formulae, the National 
Calendar of India with timings of tithis, nakshatras,”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$40e0ef30-77e2-4175-9a36-6de553251bac”h

yoga etc, and also festival dates. The era chosen 
for this calendar was the Saka Era. The work of the 
Committee was taken up by the India 
Meteorological Department from 1st December, 
1955. The work was entrusted to a unit named 
Positional Astronomy Centre at Kolkata. The unit 
undertook the preparation of â€˜The Indian 
Astronomical Ephemerisâ€™ for 1958, the first issue 
was published in 1957. Simultaneously the first 
issue of RashtriyaPanchang (containing data of 
National calendar along with usual panchang 
parameters to serve as a standard  panchang for 
whole of the country) was started from 1879 Saka 
Era (1957-58 AD).

were not visible as the phenomena happened 
before the Moonrise (at 1652 IST). The 
phenomenon of rise of the eclipsed moon could 
not be observed through the telescope of the PAC 
due to cloudiness. However, th e ending of both 
the total phase (at 1712 IST) and the partial 
(Umbral) phase (at 1819 IST) were successfully 
observed from the PAC rooftop and timings of 
occurrence of both the phenomena matched with

India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues 
operational monthly and seasonal forecasts for the 
southwest monsoon rainfall using models based on 
the latest statistical techniques with useful skill 
(Rajeevan et al., 2007, Pai et al., 2011). Since 2021,

IMD has adopted a new strategy for issuing 
monthly and seasonal operational forecasts for the

Below-normal rainfall is likely during October - 
December (OND) season 2022 over the extreme 
southern parts of the South Asia including the 
islands where climatologically we receive good 
amount of rainfall during the season. Below 
normal rainfall is also likely over the northwestern 
parts of South Asia as well as extreme eastern 
parts of South Asia which normally receive very 
low rainfall during  OND season. Above normal 
rainfall is likely over most parts of west, central 
and northeast regions and remaining area of 
southern parts of South Asia. Remaining part of 
the region is likely to experience normal or 
climatological probability for the seasonal rainfall.

â— Annual Frequency of CDs: During 2022, 15 CDs 
(maximum sustained wind speed (MSW) â‰¥ 17 
knots) developed over the NIO against normal 
(during 1965-2021) of 11.2 per year. Thus, annual 
activity of formation of CD was above normal 
during the year 2022.  
 
â— Frequency of different categories of CDs: 
There were 12 depressions and deep depressions 
(MSW: 17- 33 knots) (Normal: 6.5 per year), 1 
cyclonic storm (MSW: 34- 47 knots) (Normal: 1.8 
per year) and 2 severe cyclonic storms (MSW: 48 -
63 knots) (Normal: 2.9 per ye ar) during the year 
2022. A total of 3 cyclones (MSWâ‰¥ 34 knots) 
developed over the NIO during 2022 against 
normal of 4.7 per year. Overall, the frequency of 
formation of depressions over the region was 
above normal and that of cyclones was below 
normal during 2022.

1.1 per year) during 2022. Basin -wise activity wrt 
formation of CDs was above normal over Bay of 
Bengal, Arabian Sea and Land. 
 
â— Frequency of cyclones over Bay of Bengal  
(BoB) and Arabian Sea(AS): 3 cyclones developed 
over the BoB and zero over the AS against normal 
of 3.5 per year and 1.2 per year over the BoB and 
AS respectively. Thus, frequency of formation of CS 
over both the basins was below average.  
 
â— Unique features wrt frequency of cyclones: 
During 2022, no cyclone developed over the AS 
against normal (1965-2020) of 1.2 per year. In past, 
no cyclone over the AS was observed in 1990, 
1991, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2013, 2016, 2017.

(during the period 1982-2021).  
 
â— Frequency of CDs in different seasons: There 
were 4 CDs during pre -monsoon season (March -
May) (Normal: 1.4 per year), 6 CDs during 
monsoon season (June-September) (Normal: 4.9 
per year) and 5 during post -monsoon se ason 
(October-December) (Normal: 4.8 per year). 
Season-wise activity was above normal during pre -
monsoon season. 
 
â— Movement: Asani exhibited multiple 
recurvatures (significant change in direction of 
movement), very slow movement and weakening 
before landfall. Sitrang followed recurving track, 
very fast movement prior to landfall and very short 
life period. Mandous also followed recurving path 
and slow movement. Thus, all the 3 TCs during 
2022 had recurving tracks and either slow or fast 
movement before and during landfall and two out”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$5c02996d-1abd-4095-8b09-b964b68e0f63”h

systems (Normal: 3.2 per year). However, hileAsani 
crossed coast a deep depression, Sitrang and 
Mandous crossed coast as cyclonic storms.  
 
â— Annual Accumulated Cyclone Energy: The 
Annual Accumulated Cyclone Energy (a measure of 
damage potential) in association with cyclones 
during 2022 was 6.37  Ã— 104 knots  2 against the 
long period average (LPA) based on data of (1982 -
2020) of (a) 14.41 Ã—  104 knots 2 for cyclones over 
the BoB, (b) 6.77 Ã— 104 knots 2 over the AS and (c) 
21.18 Ã— 104 knots2 over the NIO. Thus, the 
damage potential of cyclones during 2022 was less 
as compared to annual average over the BoB, AS 
and NIO.

(b) 4.57 Ã— 106 knots3 over the AS and (c) 14.08 Ã— 
106 knots  3 over the NIO. Thus, the measure of 
loss due tocyclones during 2022 was less as 
compared to annual average over the BoB, AS and 
NIO. 
 
â— Total life period: Total number of CD days 
over the NIO during 2022  was 39 days and 9 hours 
during 2022 against the LPA (based on data during 
1990-2020) of 29 days and 20 hours. It was mainly 
due to increased frequency of depressions/ deep 
depressions instead of longer life period of any 
CDs.

normal. 
 
â— In spite of the recurving tracks and increased 
difficulty level in forecasting, all the parameters 
including genesis, track, landfall point, landfall time 
& intensity and associated adverse weather 
including heavy rainfall, wind and storm surge 
were predicted accurately with sufficient lead 
period. It enabled disaster managers, stakeholders

2.  Monitoring and forecasting 
 
IMD utilized all itâ€™s resources for monitoring and 
prediction of CDs during 2022. We are happy to 
inform you that all the cyclonic disturbances were 
monitored and predicted with sufficient lead time 
and great accuracy. IMD maintained continuous 
watch over the NIO and monitored all the 
disturbances with issue of extended range outlook 
(valid for next 15 days), daily tropical weather 
outlook (valid for next 5 days), daily detailed 
prognostic and diagnostic report during October -
December (valid for next 7 days) and 
6hourly/3hourly/hourly structured bulletins on 
formation of cyclonic disturbance period. The CDs 
were monitored with the help of available satellite 
observations from INSAT 3D and 3DR, polar 
orbiting satellites, available ships & buoy 
observations in the region, Doppler Weather”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$e4e48e62-f23a-424e-ac37-9743de7ceb18”h

5.6.  Drought Monitoring & Prediction 
 
Drought Monitoring and Prediction is being done 
using different indices like SPI (Standardized 
Precipitation Index), AAI (Aridity Anomaly Index) 
and SPEI Drought monitoring using Aridity 
Anomaly Index (AAI). The SPI maps are being 
generated every week as well as every month to 
identify the regions with prevailing or beginning/ 
ending of the extremely/ severely/ moderately”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$74578c9e-552f-4bcb-98ce-bf9a17057132”h

helps the various state government agencies for 
initiating drought management. Weekly SPI maps 
and values is being sent to all the state authorities 
as demanded b y them according to new Drought 
manual of Ministry of Agriculture.  
 
Weekly Drought monitoring using Standardized 
Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) has been 
done in the year 2020. Prediction of one -week 
advance SPI and AAI maps is being done during SW 
monsoon and NE monsoon using IMD GFS district 
rainfall forecast. SPI Forecast maps for one week to 
four weeks are also being generated using ERFS 
data.

Summary for Policymakers
Summary for Policymakers
Introduction  
This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarises the state of knowledge of climate change, 
its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. It integrates the main findings of the Sixth 
Assessment Report (AR6) based on contributions from the three Working Groups1, and the three Special Reports2. The summary 
for Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and 
Long-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. 
This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse 
forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being 
and sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action.”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$b37cf75d-7acf-4384-ad37-8e9a8df18ae6”h

confidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. Â 
1 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation 
and Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication 
respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.
2 The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5Â°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial 
levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$4af7312d-090a-4c53-97a2-7ea99d152d19”h

A. Current Status and Trends
Observed Warming and its Causes
A.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally 
caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1Â°C above 1850-1900 
in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal 
historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and 
land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, 
between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence ). {2.1, Figure 2.1, 
Figure 2.2}
A.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]Â°C 5 higher in 2011â€“2020 than 1850â€“1900 6, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]Â°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]Â°C). Global surface temperature in the first two”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$cf329363-0239-4b28-86c0-bff8a41ebbe0”h

has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years ( high confidence). 
{2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.1.2  The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850â€“1900 to 2010â€“20197 is 0.8Â°C to 
1.3Â°C, with a best estimate of 1.07Â°C. Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed 
a warming of 1.0Â°C to 2.0Â°C 8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0Â°C to 0.8Â°C, 
natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by â€“0.1Â°C to +0.1Â°C, and internal variability 
changed it by â€“0.2Â°C to +0.2Â°C. {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$065c6261-cca6-465d-9967-c8f75b3221cd”h
)”}”(h
}”(hjù  h}”(hj  hK	uhX»  from human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 Â± 240 GtCO2 
of which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high 
confidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 
million years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per 
billion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.1.4 Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 Â± 6.6 GtCO2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) 
higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions 
occurring in CO2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$a78a9587-c396-49be-80d4-078212c27539”h
)”}”(h
}”(hj   h}”(hj  hK	uhXÊ  relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions 
during 2010â€“2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and 
2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1). In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG 
5 Ranges given throughout the SPM represent very likely ranges (5â€“95% range) unless otherwise stated.
6 The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003â€“2012 (0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] Â°C). Additionally, 
methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the 
Arctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1Â°C, but this increase 
does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$f8463b45-e9de-4082-b961-9c2117eb05ad”h

7 The period distinction with A.1.1 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010â€“2019 
is 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]Â°C.
8 Contributions from emissions to the 2010â€“2019 warming relative to 1850â€“1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO 2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]Â°C; 
methane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]Â°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]Â°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]Â°C. {2.1.1}
9 GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-
equivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to 
the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$723ab3a4-7734-4f90-bd20-582631c9160a”h

Summary for Policymakers
emissions came from the sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together and 22% 10 from agriculture, 
forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Emissions reductions in CO 2 -FFI due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP 
and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, 
energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. ( high confidence) {2.1.1}
A.1.5 Historical contributions of CO 2  emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in 
terms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO 2  emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO 2 -LULUCF). 
In 2019, around 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO 2 -eq per capita 11 (excluding 
CO 2 -LULUCF) while 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO 2 -eq per capita; of the latter a substantial share lacks”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$c24d1055-2bb8-41a4-8fc0-f32646c27ddb”h

Observed Changes and Impacts
A.2 Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have 
occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate 
extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and 
related losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities

affected (high confidence). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.1  It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by 
0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr -1  between 1901 
and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr -1  between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr -1  
between 2006 and 2018 ( high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at 
least 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical 
cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$d71e0329-e198-427e-8642-6eea42c17dc1”h

A.2.2 Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Human and 
ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high

Development Goals ( high confidence). Although overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change has 
slowed this growth over the past 50 years globally ( medium confidence), with related negative impacts mainly in mid- 
and low latitude regions but positive impacts in some high latitude regions ( high confidence). Ocean warming and 
ocean acidification have adversely affected food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture in some oceanic

Current Progress in Adaptation and Gaps and Challenges
A.3 Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all sectors and regions, 
with documented benefits and varying effectiveness. Despite progress, adaptation gaps 
exist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. Hard and soft limits to 
adaptation have been reached in some ecosystems and regions. Maladaptation is happening 
in some sectors and regions. Current global financial flows for adaptation are insufficient 
for, and constrain implementation of, adaptation options, especially in developing countries 
(high confidence). {2.2, 2.3}
A.3.1 Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating 
multiple benefits  (very high confidence ). Growing public and political awareness of climate impacts and risks has”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$bc37ef46-0dc4-4209-9994-6e77f6ee27fd”h

(high confidence). {2.2.3}
A.3.2 Effectiveness 15  of adaptation in reducing climate risks 16  is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions ( high

storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level 
diversification in agriculture, sustainable land management approaches, use of agroecological principles and practices 
and other approaches that work with natural processes  (high confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation17  approaches 
such as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been effective in reducing 
flood risks and urban heat (high confidence). Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$ad298a81-7693-4057-8b34-315f84b7ba10”h

options such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social safety nets have broad

A.3.3 Most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental 18 , sector-specific and unequally distributed across 
regions. Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist across sectors and regions, and will continue to grow under current 
levels of implementation, with the largest adaptation gaps among lower income groups. (high confidence) {2.3.2}

A.3.6 Key barriers to adaptation are limited resources, lack of private sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilization 
of finance (including for research), low climate literacy, lack of political commitment, limited research and/or slow and 
low uptake of adaptation science, and low sense of urgency. There are widening disparities between the estimated costs 
of adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation  ( high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly 
from public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an 
overwhelming majority to mitigation  ( very high confidence ). Although global tracked climate finance has shown 
an upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance”•·     hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$ce8f3f10-98bb-41f9-941a-8f2c44ec0641”h

confidence).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages 
and through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, 
particularly for developing and least developed countries ( medium confidence) . {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
Box SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report
Modelled scenarios and pathways 19 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and 
possible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables 
and mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$485155c0-bb49-44ad-ab2a-7f63552dfaf0”h

and have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about 
global equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions 
underlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures. 20 {Cross-Section Box.2}
WGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) 21 that 
cover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. High and 
very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 22) have CO 2  emissions that roughly double from current levels 
by 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO 2  emissions remaining around”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$24e14f52-ad8a-4b52-a2df-54aec157ef4d”h

}”(hj¶  h}”(hj  hKuhX§  current levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have 
CO 2  emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO 2  
emissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate 
changes, impacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 
pathways were categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5Â°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to 
pathways that exceed 4Â°C (C8).  {Cross-Section Box.2} ( Box SPM.1, Table 1)
Global warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850â€“1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$c80b293e-957f-4e18-b9ae-bc6cecef33be”h

independent of timing when that level is reached. { Cross-Section Box.2}
19 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI 
primarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when 
referring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.
20 Around half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The 
other half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.
21 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where â€˜SSPxâ€™ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$ae501d9f-e9a0-4ebb-8153-6c6ef223cec0”h

22 Very high emissions scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4Â°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can 
also occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {3.1.1}
23 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where â€˜yâ€™ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m -2) resulting from the 
scenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not 
identical, with differences in concentration trajectories. The overall effective radiative forcing tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to the RCPs with the 
same label (medium confidence). {Cross-Section Box.2}”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$df2e6a8a-b9f0-49a9-9244-c93ae460c577”h

Current Mitigation Progress, Gaps and Challenges
A.4 Policies and laws addressing mitigation have consistently expanded since AR5. Global GHG 
emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced by October 
2021 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5Â°C during the 21st century and make it harder 
to limit warming below 2Â°C. There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented 
policies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of the levels needed to meet climate 
goals across all sectors and regions. (high confidence) {2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.5, Table 2.2}
A.4.1 The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement are supporting rising levels of national ambition. The Paris Agreement, 
adopted under the UNFCCC, with near universal participation, has led to policy development and target-setting at national”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$1c134bc6-5f19-49f4-bacf-2d6d45cd5875”h

support (medium confidence). Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully 
(high confidence). In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and 
accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions ( high 
confidence). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to several 24 Gt CO2-eq yr-1 of avoided 
global emissions ( medium confidence ). At least 18 countries have sustained absolute production-based GHG and 
consumption-based CO2 reductions25 for longer than 10 years. These reductions have only partly offset global emissions 
growth (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2}
A.4.2 Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure,”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$cf47293b-37ed-4950-898d-8fac4d3dd955”h

numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and were estimated to result in 5.9 GtCO2-eq yrâ€“1 less emissions in 2016 than they 
otherwise would have been. (medium confidence) {2.2.2}
25 Reductions were linked to energy supply decarbonisation, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and 
changes in economic structure (high confidence). {2.2.2}”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$cf096a5f-353f-460d-857d-0e46188b2bc9”h

(55%), and lithium-ion batteries (85%), and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10Ã— for solar and >100Ã— for 
electric vehicles (EVs), varying widely across regions. The mix of policy instruments that reduced costs and stimulated 
adoption includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as 
deployment subsidies to attain scale. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be 
more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems. ( high confidence) {2.2.2, Figure 2.4}
A.4.3  A substantial â€˜emissions gapâ€™ exists between global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of 
NDCs announced prior to COP26 26 and those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5Â°C”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$509ffeb0-ff95-4a1c-b4e1-25f282f0f515”h

would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5Â°C during the 21st century ( high confidence). Global modelled mitigation 
pathways that limit warming to 1.5Â°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2Â°C (>67%) assuming 
immediate action imply deep global GHG emissions reductions this decade ( high confidence) (see SPM Box 1, Table 1, B.6) 27. 
Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in 
ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4] Â°C by 2100  ( medium 
confidence) . Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2  by around mid-century 
but pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$31168e18-496c-4d6c-8eac-ae9bfdb715b0”h

A.4.4 Policy coverage is uneven across sectors ( high confidence). Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to 
result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than emissions implied by NDCs, indicating an â€˜implementation gapâ€™ 
( high confidence). Without a strengthening of policies, global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5] Â°C is projected by 2100 
( medium confidence).  {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 3.1.1, Figure 2.5} ( Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.5)
A.4.5  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due 
in part to limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity ( medium confidence ). The magnitude 
of climate finance flows has increased over the last decade and financing channels have broadened but growth has 
slowed since 2018 ( high confidence ). Financial flows have developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$6ab340a5-971a-4304-b057-bb38ab23d10a”h

and mitigation ( high confidence). The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation, 
but nevertheless falls short of the levels needed to limit warming to below 2Â°C or to 1.5Â°C across all sectors and 
regions (see C7.2) ( very high confidence ). In 2018, public and publicly mobilised private climate finance flows from 
developed to developing countries were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilise 
USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation

B. Future Climate Change, Risks, and Long-Term Responses
Future Climate Change 
B.1 Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best 
estimate of reaching 1.5Â°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. 
Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards ( high 
confidence). Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would 
lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also 
to discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years  (high confidence ). 
{Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.1, 4.3 } (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1)
B.1.1 Global warming 28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021â€“2040) mainly due to increased cumulative 
CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$8c35106b-e205-4abb-abe9-81cb90772420”h

exceed 1.5Â°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates 
of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5Â°C is reached lie in the near term 29. Global warming declines back 
to below 1.5Â°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed 
climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081â€“2100 that spans a range 
from 1.4Â°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7Â°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario 
(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4Â°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for 
corresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$8870e624-54cc-4cd1-923d-af326f2abdb8”h

and SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32 within around 20 years. Under 
these contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air 
quality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions 
reductions.  Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years 
compared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios 
that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions33. (high confidence) {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)
B.1.3 Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system components. With every additional increment of global”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$34a97a86-9dbe-45ac-987e-5432e26b7e32”h

the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation, and very wet and very dry weather and 
28 Global warming (see Annex I: Glossary) is here reported as running 20-year averages, unless stated otherwise, relative to 1850â€“1900. Global surface 
temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-caused trend, due to natural variability. The internal variability of global 
surface temperature in a single year is estimated to be about Â±0.25Â°C (5â€“95% range, high confidence). The occurrence of individual years with global 
surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. {4.3, Cross-Section Box.2}

60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence). In all scenarios considered in WGI except the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), 
the midpoint of the first 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change reaches 1.5Â°C lies in the 
first half of the 2030s. In the very high GHG emissions scenario, the midpoint is in the late 2020s. {3.1.1, 3.3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)

(SSP2-4.5); 3.6 [2.8 to 4.6]Â°C (SSP3-7.0); and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7 ]Â°C (SSP5-8.5). {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$56efc7c3-fe5f-413c-aa52-7da16480aa36”h

31 Assessed future changes in global surface temperature have been constructed, for the first time, by combining multi-model projections with observational 
constraints and the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response. The uncertainty range is narrower than in the AR5 thanks to 
improved knowledge of climate processes, paleoclimate evidence and model-based emergent constraints. {3.1.1}

even higher at 2Â°C ( high confidence). Compared to the AR5, global aggregated risk levels 37 (Reasons for Concern 38) are 
assessed to become high to very high at lower levels of global warming due to recent evidence of observed impacts, 
improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems,”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$b3babc45-b388-4dd5-9c36-78a8a0843a85”h

B.2.3 With further warming, climate change risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple 
climatic and non-climatic risk drivers will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across 
sectors and regions. Climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability, for example, are projected to increase with 
increasing global warming, interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban 
expansion and food production, pandemics and conflict. ( high confidence)  {3.1.2, 4.3, Figure 4.3}

including migration, growing inequality and urbanisation. Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements 
and rapidly growing smaller settlements. In rural areas vulnerability will be heightened by high reliance on climate-
sensitive livelihoods. Vulnerability of ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of 
unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and 
management of land, ocean, and water. Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on

of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increases 
with higher global warming levels. (high confidence) {3.1}
B.3.1 Limiting global surface temperature does not prevent continued changes in climate system components that have 
multi-decadal or longer timescales of response (high confidence). Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia 
due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years 
(high confidence). However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$26f1e40f-f08c-4160-b193-21a1a5b59148”h

level rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is 0.15â€“0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28â€“0.55 m by 2100; while for the 
SSP5-8.5 GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20â€“0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63â€“1.01 m by 2100 ( medium confidence). Over the 
next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2â€“3 m if warming is limited to 1.5Â°C and 2â€“6 m if limited to 
2Â°C (low confidence). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4} (Box SPM.1)
B.3.2 The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered 
when tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence). As warming levels increase, so 
do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests (medium confidence),”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$3fb6f831-5d6c-43d5-ad3e-cd264d07f25d”h

causing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher 
global surface temperatures (high confidence). {3.1.2, 3.1.3}

Adaptation Options and their Limits in a Warmer World
B.4 Adaptation options that are feasible and effective today will become constrained and 
less effective with increasing global warming. With increasing global warming, losses and 
damages will increase and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation 
limits. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term 
planning and implementation of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and 
systems. (high confidence) {3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 }
B.4.1 The effectiveness of adaptation, including ecosystem-based and most water-related options, will decrease with 
increasing warming. The feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that 
differentiate responses based on climate risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. As adaptation options”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$823beee9-567b-464b-87bb-ca9bd6f6b192”h

4.1, 4.2} 
B.4.2 With additional global warming, limits to adaptation and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among vulnerable 
populations, will become increasingly difficult to avoid ( high confidence ). Above 1.5Â°C of global warming, limited 
freshwater resources pose potential hard adaptation limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier 
and snow melt ( medium confidence ). Above that level, ecosystems such as some warm-water coral reefs, coastal 
wetlands, rainforests, and polar and mountain ecosystems will have reached or surpassed hard adaptation limits and as

reduce impacts to people and assets in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate 
risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan. Maladaptive responses can worsen 
existing inequities especially for Indigenous Peoples and marginalised groups and decrease ecosystem and biodiversity 
resilience. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term planning and implementation 
of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {2.3.2, 3.2}

gas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to 
1.5Â°C or 2Â°C (high confidence). Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure 
without additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5Â°C (50%) 
(high confidence). {2.3, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1}
B.5.1 From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative 
CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. 
Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO 2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and 
implies net negative CO 2 emissions39. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to achieve net negative CO 2”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$a6cc74f3-152c-4024-ac91-5e0edc70f773”h

temperatures after an earlier peak. (high confidence) {3.1.1, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.1}
B.5.2 For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global surface temperature rises by 0.45Â°C (best estimate, with a likely 
range from 0.27Â°C to 0.63Â°C). The best estimates of the remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of 2020 are 
500 GtCO2 for a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C and 1150 GtCO 2 for a 67% likelihood of limiting 
warming to 2Â°C40. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given 
remaining carbon budget or the larger remaining carbon budget for the same level of temperature change41. {3.3.1}

B.5.3 If the annual CO 2  emissions between 2020â€“2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative 
emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5Â°C (50%), and deplete more than a third of the 
remaining carbon budget for 2Â°C (67%). Estimates of future CO 2  emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures 
without additional abatement 42 already exceed the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5Â°C (50%) 
( high confidence ). Projected cumulative future CO 2  emissions over the lifetime of existing and planned fossil fuel 
infrastructure, if historical operating patterns are maintained and without additional abatement 43, are approximately 
equal to the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 2Â°C with a likelihood of 83% 44 ( high confidence). { 2.3.1,

B.5.4  Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO 2  emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about 
four fifths 45 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C (central estimate about 
2900 GtCO 2 ), and to about two thirds 46 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2Â°C

Mitigation Pathways
B.6  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5Â°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, 
and those that limit warming to 2Â°C (>67%), involve rapid and deep and, in most cases, 
immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. Global net zero CO2 
emissions are reached for these pathway categories, in the early 2050s and around the early 
2070s, respectively. (high confidence) {3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.5, Table 3.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$2e9b4be5-187b-4c64-990f-03c20b929ddd”h

B.6.1  Global modelled pathways provide information on limiting warming to different levels; these pathways, particularly 
their sectoral and regional aspects, depend on the assumptions described in Box SPM.1. Global modelled pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5Â°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2Â°C (>67%) are characterized by deep, 
rapid, and, in most cases, immediate GHG emissions reductions. Pathways that limit warming to 1.5 Â°C (>50%) with no 
or limited overshoot reach net zero CO 2  in the early 2050s, followed by net negative CO 2  emissions. Those pathways that 
reach net zero GHG emissions do so around the 2070s. Pathways that limit warming to 2 Â°C (>67%) reach net zero CO 2  
emissions in the early 2070s. Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$f697b8fa-4466-4efa-ba19-1feffa9c97b1”h

B.6.2 Reaching net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions primarily requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions of CO 2, as 
well as substantial reductions of non-CO 2 GHG emissions ( high confidence). For example, in modelled pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5Â°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, global methane emissions are reduced by 34 [21â€“57] %”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$243aa48c-7456-46de-a6d0-d9c0348c77fb”h

aviation, shipping, and industrial processes) remain and would need to be counterbalanced by deployment of CDR 
methods to achieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions (high confidence). As a result, net zero CO2 is reached earlier than 
net zero GHGs (high confidence). {3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.5} (Figure SPM.5)
B.6.3 Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels 
without carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels 
with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR47 . In most global 
modelled pathways, land-use change and forestry (via reforestation and reduced deforestation) and the energy supply”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$77a07c76-79dc-49d4-a839-fcf117a55809”h

4.1, 4.5, Figure 4.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)
B.6.4 Mitigation options often have synergies with other aspects of sustainable development, but some options can also 
have trade-offs. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency 
and renewable energy. Similarly, depending on the context 48 , biological CDR methods like reforestation, improved 
forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management can enhance 
biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods. However, afforestation or production of 
biomass crops can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water 
security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$f5f4c47b-cdb5-4e5c-9829-04ec4ec01a72”h

towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as less dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity. 
(high confidence) {3.4.1}
47  CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO 2  is 
captured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO 2  capture and 
subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the 
power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$3ff1a27c-a658-44e0-b21e-098af764cf8b”h

availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the CO 2  
can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental 
and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C to 2Â°C. 
Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers. ( high confidence)  {3.3.3}

Overshoot: Exceeding a Warming Level and Returning
B.7 If warming exceeds a specified level such as 1.5Â°C, it could gradually be reduced again by 
achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions. This would require additional 
deployment of carbon dioxide removal, compared to pathways without overshoot, leading 
to greater feasibility and sustainability concerns. Overshoot entails adverse impacts, some 
irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems, all growing with the 
magnitude and duration of overshoot. (high confidence) {3.1, 3.3, 3.4, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6}
B.7.1 Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5Â°C (>50%) by 2100 
without exceeding this level temporarily. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions, with annual rates”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$ae50d7f6-d084-4062-8b7e-ff0ea84f6c75”h

impacts that occur during this period of overshoot and cause additional warming via feedback mechanisms, such as 
increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and permafrost thawing, weakening natural land 
carbon sinks and increasing releases of GHGs would make the return more challenging ( medium confidence). {3.3.2, 
3.3.4, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6} (Box SPM.1)
B.7.2 The higher the magnitude and the longer the duration of overshoot, the more ecosystems and societies are exposed 
to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, increasing risks for many natural and human 
systems. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies would face higher risks to infrastructure, low-lying 
coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5Â°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$0bc7b970-5268-4c5c-9b6a-e60568ba0e6a”h

peak warming levels and reduce the requirement for net negative CO 2 emissions, thereby reducing feasibility and

C.1.1 Evidence of observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, projected risks, levels and trends in vulnerability 
and adaptation limits, demonstrate that worldwide climate resilient development action is more urgent than previously 
assessed in AR5. Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable 
development for all. Climate resilient development pathways have been constrained by past development, emissions 
and climate change and are progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5Â°C.

Figure SPM.6: The illustrative development pathways (red to green) and associated outcomes (right panel) show that there is a rapidly narrowing window 
of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Climate resilient development is the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and 
adaptation measures to support sustainable development. Diverging pathways illustrate that interacting choices and actions made by diverse government, 
private sector and civil society actors can advance climate resilient development, shift pathways towards sustainability, and enable lower emissions and 
adaptation. Diverse knowledge and values include cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge. Climatic and non-climatic 
events, such as droughts, floods or pandemics, pose more severe shocks to pathways with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) than to pathways”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$ca340d97-7283-4dca-baee-bc4494f0e315”h

of 1.5Â°C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic 
development impact GHG emissions and mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. Pathways and opportunities for 
action are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed; dashed pathway) and enabling and constraining conditions (left panel), and 
take place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. The longer emissions reductions are delayed, the fewer effective adaptation

C.2.2 Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming and losses and damages will rise and additional human 
and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Challenges from delayed adaptation and mitigation actions include the 
risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation 
and mitigation options. Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses 
and damages will continue to increase,  including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South 
America 49, Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. (high confidence)

healthy diets ( high confidence ). Strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term 
warming and improve air quality by reducing global surface ozone ( high confidence) . Adaptation can generate multiple 
additional benefits such as improving agricultural productivity, innovation, health and well-being, food security, 
livelihood, and biodiversity conservation ( very high confidence) . {4.2, 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.6}
C.2.4 Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all avoided damages from climate change ( high 
confidence). The economic benefits for human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation action can 
be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger ( medium confidence). Even without”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$4b5eacf7-7843-492c-aa5a-b2d5fefd7412”h

warming to 2Â°C exceeds the cost of mitigation in most of the assessed literature ( medium confidence) 50. More rapid 
climate change mitigation, with emissions peaking earlier, increases co-benefits and reduces feasibility risks and costs 
in the long-term, but requires higher up-front investments ( high confidence). { 3.4.1, 4.2}
C.2.5 Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in existing economic structures, with

Mexico is considered part of Latin America and the Caribbean for WGIII.
50 The evidence is too limited to make a similar robust conclusion for limiting warming to 1.5Â°C. Limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C instead of 2Â°C would 
increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks, and reduced adaptation needs ( high

sinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios 
from the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included 
mostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching 
to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy 
context dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25â€“50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$c2c157aa-48e7-42ce-9baf-7843522ccba0”h

the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, 
this projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural

options, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement 
technologies and transformational changes in production processes ( high confidence ). In transport, sustainable 
biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives (including ammonia and synthetic fuels) can support mitigation of 
CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements 
and cost reductions ( medium confidence). Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based 
transport in the short and medium term ( medium confidence ). Electric vehicles powered by low-GHG emissions”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$d05dcae5-eda0-4004-86e2-a56c6252101b”h

Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional 
electric rail systems ( medium confidence). The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns 
about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency 
improvements, and circular material flows (medium confidence). {4.5.2, 4.5.3} (Figure SPM.7)
Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure 
C.3.4 Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development ( high

sources (high confidence). Urban transitions that offer benefits for mitigation, adaptation, human health and well-
being, ecosystem services, and vulnerability reduction for low-income communities are fostered by inclusive long-term 
planning that takes an integrated approach to physical, natural and social infrastructure ( high confidence ). Green/
natural and blue infrastructure supports carbon uptake and storage and either singly or when combined with grey

Land, Ocean, Food, and Water
C.3.5 Many agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) options provide adaptation and mitigation benefits that could 
be upscaled in the near term across most regions. Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests 
and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical 
regions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to 
trade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple 
objectives including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable healthy diets53 and reducing food loss/
waste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion, and methane and nitrous oxide”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$a76124bb-e530-47f7-a235-198d2e25d344”h

products, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. 
Effective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and 
landscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, 
socioeconomic and other enabling factors. Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems (e.g., peatlands, 
wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests), deliver immediate benefits, while others, such as restoration of high-carbon 
ecosystems, take decades to deliver measurable results. (high confidence) {4.5.4} (Figure SPM.7)

C.3.7 Human health will benefit from integrated mitigation and adaptation options that mainstream health into food, 
infrastructure, social protection, and water policies ( very high confidence ) . Effective adaptation options exist to help 
protect human health and well-being, including: strengthening public health programs related to climate-sensitive 
diseases, increasing health systems resilience, improving ecosystem health, improving access to potable water, 
reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding, improving surveillance and early warning systems,

 C.3.8 Policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive social safety nets, contingent 
finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can 
reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems. Disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services

Synergies and Trade-Offs with Sustainable Development 
C.4 Accelerated and equitable action in mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts is 
critical to sustainable development. Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies 
than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals. Synergies and trade-offs depend on 
context and scale of implementation. (high confidence) {3.4, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.9, Figure 4.5}
C.4.1 Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission 
reductions ( medium confidence). Countries at all stages of economic development seek to improve the well-being of 
people, and their development priorities reflect different starting points and contexts. Different contexts include but”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$458b95c6-22fa-4352-9510-20e957e7d9d6”h

international environment, and prior development ( high confidence). In regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, 
among other things, revenue and employment generation, mitigating risk for sustainable development requires policies 
that promote economic and energy sector diversification and considerations of just transitions principles, processes 
and practices ( high confidence). Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards in 
low-emitting countries / regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can

C.4.3 Implementing both mitigation and adaptation actions together and taking trade-offs into account supports co-benefits 
and synergies for human health and well-being. For example, improved access to clean energy sources and technologies 
generates health benefits especially for women and children; electrification combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts 
to active mobility and public transport can enhance air quality, health, employment, and can elicit energy security and 
deliver equity.  ( high confidence)  {4.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.5, 4.6, 4.9}
Equity and Inclusion
C.5 Prioritising equity, climate justice, social justice, inclusion and just transition processes can 
enable adaptation and ambitious mitigation actions and climate resilient development. 
Adaptation outcomes are enhanced by increased support to regions and people with the 
highest vulnerability to climatic hazards. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$094e91ab-ade0-4109-b5d9-a798975f9579”h

programs improves resilience. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive 
consumption, including through behavioural and lifestyle changes, with co-benefits for 
societal well-being. (high confidence) {4.4, 4.5}
C.5.1 Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states 
over time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive 
changes in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries. Distributional 
consequences within and between countries include shifting of income and employment during the transition from 
high- to low-emissions activities. ( high confidence)  {4.4}
C.5.2 Adaptation and mitigation actions that prioritise equity, social justice, climate justice, rights-based approaches, and”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$92cf7ddc-b4f2-4a80-9de0-bf02a6ffe42c”h

resilient development. Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social 
safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-
offs with sustainable development goals. Attention to equity and broad and meaningful participation of all relevant 
actors in decision making at all scales can build social trust which builds on equitable sharing of benefits and burdens 
of mitigation that deepen and widen support for transformative changes.  ( high confidence)  {4.4}
C.5.3 Regions and people (3.3 to 3.6 billion in number) with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to 
climatic hazards (see A.2.2). Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$9f35a355-d2f1-4c13-a878-cb0e26674e6d”h

by inequity and marginalisation linked to e.g., gender, ethnicity, low incomes, informal settlements, disability, age, 
and historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local 
communities. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works 
programs, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services 
and infrastructure. The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising access to finance to 
reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements. ( high

C.5.4  The design of regulatory instruments and economic instruments and consumption-based approaches, can advance equity. 
Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential 
for emissions reductions. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive consumption while improving 
societal well-being. Socio-cultural options, behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure, and 
technology can help end-users shift to low-emissions-intensive consumption, with multiple co-benefits.  A substantial 
share of the population in low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. Technology development, 
transfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries / regions leapfrogging or transitioning to 
low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits. Climate resilient development is advanced”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$4bb73082-e347-4d29-9b68-179e2052d7bb”h

Governance and Policies  
C.6 Effective climate action is enabled by political commitment, well-aligned multilevel 
governance, institutional frameworks, laws, policies and strategies and enhanced access 
to finance and technology. Clear goals, coordination across multiple policy domains, and 
inclusive governance processes facilitate effective climate action. Regulatory and economic 
instruments can support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and

Finance, Technology and International Cooperation
C.7 Finance, technology and international cooperation are critical enablers for accelerated climate

C.7.2 Increased access to finance can build capacity and address soft limits to adaptation and avert rising risks, especially for

{4.3, 4.8.1}
C.7.3 There is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close global investment gaps, given the size of the global financial 
system, but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action both within and outside the global financial sector and

Accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler 
to enhance adaptation and mitigation actions and address inequities in access to finance, including its costs, terms

It is a continuous, data-intensive, multidimensional, dynamic and chaotic process. These properties make weather forecasting is a formidable challenge. Forecasting is the process of estimation in unknown situations from the historical data. Weather forecasting is one of the most scientifically and technologically challenging problems around the world in the last century. To make an accurate prediction is indeed, one of the major challenges that meteorologists are facing all over the world. Since ancient times, weather prediction has been one of the most interesting and fascinating domains. Scientists have tried to forecast meteorological characteristics using a number of methods, some of these methods being more accurate than others [MK02]. Knowledge of meteorology forms the basis of scientific weather forecasting, which revolves around predicting the state of the atmosphere for”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$67e06687-03ba-4021-87ff-d1015a49a6ea”h

Weather forecasting as practiced by humans is an example of having to make judgments in the presence of uncertainty. Weather forecasts are often made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve in future. Over the last few years the necessity of increasing knowledge about the cognitive process in weather forecasting has been recognized. For human practitioners, forecasting the weather becomes a task for which the details can be uniquely personal, although most human forecasters use approaches based on the science of meteorology in common to deal with the challenges of the task [Do04].Weather forecasting entails predicting how the present state of the atmosphere will change.

Modern high-speed computers transfer the many thousands of observations onto surface and upper-air maps.Weather forecasts provide critical information about future weather. There are various techniques involved in weather forecasting, from relatively simple observation of the sky to highly complex computerized mathematical models. Weather prediction could be one day/one week or a few months ahead              [MK02, D086, AP01]. The accuracy of weather forecasts however, falls significantly beyond a week. Weather forecasting remains a complex business, due to its chaotic and unpredictable nature [KB98, MA94]. It remains a process that is neither wholly science nor wholly art. It is known that persons with little or no formal training can develop considerable forecasting skill [Ge78, KO02]. For example, farmers often are quite capable of making their own short term forecasts of those meteorological factors that directly influence their”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$e74a4bc6-4b7a-41ba-ab0d-33bf213336f2”h

Accurate weather forecast models are important to third world countries, where the entire agriculture depends upon weather [CZ97]. It is thus a major concern to identify any trends for weather parameters to deviate from its periodicity, which would disrupt the economy of the country. This fear has been aggravated due to threat by the global warming and green house effect. The impact of extreme weather phenomena on society is growing more and more costly, causing infrastructure damage, injury and the loss of life.As practiced by the professionally trained meteorologist, weather forecasting today is a highly developed skill that is grounded in scientific principle and”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$706495b6-f617-40fa-ad69-d738208d6e6f”h

One is the development of statistical methods for enhancing the scope and accuracy of model predictions. Another is the improved observational capability afforded by meteorological satellites. A third primary reason for the increase in accuracy is the continued improvement of the initial conditions prepared for the forecast models. Statistical methods allow a wider variety of meteorological elements to be predicted than do the models alone, and they tailor the geographically less precise model forecasts to specific locations. Satellites now provide the capability for nearly continuous viewing and remote sensing of the atmosphere on a global scale. The improvement in initial conditions is the result of an increased number of observations and better use of the observations in computational techniques”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$5cd8728b-3536-4f32-b8c5-c2e9331b8b73”h

Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve. There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.   In ancient times, forecasting was mostly based on weather pattern observation. Over the years, the study of weather patterns has resulted in various techniques for rainfall forecasting. Present rainfall forecasting embodies a combination of computer models, interpretation, and an acquaintance of weather patterns. The following technique was used for existing weather”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$34963fde-4b4a-44e8-8fbd-a9f5d97064ed”h

The larger the change in pressure, the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain [TF05]. Looking at the skyAlong with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the most important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is an indication of rain in the near future. At night, high thin clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates the approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds which prevent fog formation [KMQ10]. NowcastingThe forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting. In this time range, it is possible to forecast”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$50022e2f-7bd7-4286-812e-59c302aa7e83”h

In this time range, it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human, given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours [RR03].Analog techniqueThe analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall in places such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar technique is used in medium range forecasting, which is known as”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$f16b8709-d520-4b09-88f3-154c4ae93aa1”h

Numerical Weather Prediction modelNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is the science of predicting the weather using models of the atmosphere and computational techniques. Current weather conditions are used at the input of the mathematical models of the atmosphere to predict the weather. This model usually provides surrounding point around the wind farm with a spatial resolution of a few kilometers.NWP uses the power of computers to make a forecast. A forecaster examines how the features predicted by the computer will interact to produce the day's weather. The NWP method is flawed in that the equations used by the models to simulate the atmosphere are not precise [Ry02]. A number of weather forecasting agencies operate modeling centers where supercomputers are used to run NWP models that span the entire globe. These include the National Center”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$fd8cacd9-70f4-4dbf-b09d-fa2a7add8dbc”h

These include the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in the United States, the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO), and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Although costly, a global approach to NWP is essential, especially for long-range forecasting. For this reason, achieving accurate forecasts requires an accurate analysis from which to get the model started. This involves a computer-based process called data assimilation, in which the most recent weather observations from around the world are combined with model forecasts to create a global analysis of current conditions. This becomes the starting point for the next run of the NWP model, and is the computer equivalent of the manual analysis cycle that forecasters carry out on an on-going basis.

The equations are programmed into a computer and the data on the present atmospheric conditions are fed into the computer. The computer solves the equations to determine how the different atmospheric variables will change over the next few minutes. The computer repeats this procedure again and again using the output from one cycle as the input for the next cycle. For some desired time in the future, the computer prints its calculated information. It then analyzes the data, drawing the lines for the projected position of the various pressure systems. A forecaster uses the prognostic chart as a guide to predicting the weather.

Weather forecasts made for 12 and 24 hours are typically accurate. Forecasts made for two or three days are usually good. Beyond above five days, forecast accuracy falls off rapidly.Weather information can also come from remote sensing, particularly radar and satellites.RadarRadar stands for Radio Detection and Ranging. In radar, a transmitter sends out radio waves. The radio waves bounce off the nearest object and then return to a receiver. Weather radar can sense many characteristics of precipitation, its location, motion, intensity, and the likelihood of future precipitation. Most weather radar is Doppler radar, which can also track how fast the precipitation falls. Radar can outline the structure of a storm and in doing so estimates the possibility that it will produce severe weather condition [NCW12].Weather satellites”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$97a8e409-f17c-4bad-95f0-7ad060d42ddf”h

They are able to record long-term changes. Figure 1.1 shows one of the geostationary satellites that monitors conditions over the world.

uhXQ  years (2001-2010) is collected from the Indian Meteorological department of Kanyakumari District, Tamilnadu. The chosen weather data is divided into two groups, the training group, corresponding to 75% of the data, and the test group corresponding to 25% of data. Weather forecasts today depend on collecting and analyzing data and measurements from around the world. Some of the misclassified data are taken from Weather.com and AccuWeather.com. It was supported the meteorologists in analyzing and predicting customized weather forecasts for a city or metropolitan area rather than providing general users with the ability to manipulate and interactively identify possible threats associated with impending weather hazards [HTTP2, HTTP3]. The data set contains fourteen attributes. They are1. Bar Temperature2. Bar reading3. Station level pressure”hh	uhNh”(hhhhNubŒ$a2bd31bd-c8c3-42cf-bc37-5f350ed79a8e”h
